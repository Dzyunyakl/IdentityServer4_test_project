# IdentityServer4_test_project
In this project I'm using PostgreSQL (through EF Core), and IdentityServer4 for configuring authentication and authorization. 
Oh right! I forgot to tell on what platform this project is built. Aaaand luckily it's ASP.NET Core 2.1!!! The latest version atm.
Luckily, because it is my favourite backend technology, provided by Microsoft Company.
